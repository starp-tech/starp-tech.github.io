# starpy.me website 

### About
Starpy.me is a tiny web app for file sharing and media streaming that works in sync with the desktop app like OBS and youtube but all in one app.

### Disclaimer
this website started as just a simple page to distribute the desktop app so it's in pure vanilla javascript. But currently the website went into another direction with all the peer media and file sharing stuff. So the plan is to use web components and vanilla javascript here so it will be possible to move everything to separate web embeds when the time comes.
